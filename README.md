# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Multiplayer/Single Player with Minimax AI)

This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows both **multiplayer** and **single-player** modes. In single-player mode, the player competes against the computer, which uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves.

## Features

- **Multiplayer mode**: Play against a friend on the same device.
- **Single-player mode**: Play against the computer with AI powered by the Minimax algorithm.
- **Terminal-based interface**: The game runs in the command line/terminal.
- **Optimal AI**: In single-player mode, the AI makes the best possible moves using Minimax to ensure it doesnâ€™t lose.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed. 

3. No additional libraries are required for this project as it only uses built-in Python modules.

## How to Play

### Multiplayer Mode

- The game will prompt each player to input their move (row and column) on the board.
- Players alternate turns, and the first one to align three marks (either 'X' or 'O') wins.

### Single-player Mode (Player vs Computer)

- The player will input their move (row and column), and then the AI will make its move using the Minimax algorithm.
- The AI will always attempt to make the best possible move, and it's nearly impossible for the player to win if playing optimally.

## Example

When running the game in single-player mode, the game interface will look like this:
